## Basics Library

### Basic Library

#### Roll

Takes in an int and simulates rolling a 6 sided die that amount of times and returns an array of those rolls. We'll iterate adding  a random number between 1 and 6 into an array until we've reached the desired number

#### Contains Duplicate

Check to see if an array contains Duplicates by iterating through it.

#### Calculate Average

Take in an array of ints and calculate the average.

#### Array of Arrays

Take in 2d array. Return the array with the lowest average temperature.

### Linter

#### Analyze Weather

Take in a 2d array. Use a hashset to generate a unique list of weather data from a month. Iterate through the data and output a string listing all numbers between the lowest and highest that didn't occur.

#### LintJS

Take in a string file path. Review the document to determine which lines are incorrectly missing semicolons and return those line numbers in a string.
